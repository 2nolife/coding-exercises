- Java 8+
- TDD would be great; write some tests first, make sure they fail, then write enough impl to make them pass!
- Feel free to mock whatever you think you need
- There are no traps or a "correct" way to do things; do it however you feel comfortable 
- Feel free to use online resources if you need to
- Feel free to ask questions
