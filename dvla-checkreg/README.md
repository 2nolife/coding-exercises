Please pay attention to the following parts:
============================================

1. Looks like the real deal "https://www.gov.uk/get-vehicle-information-from-dvla"
   Pages were simply copy/pasted and then modified with Play data

2. Enquiry page validation "Vehicle make" list preserved

3. Enquiry page validation highlights errorneous fields

4. Vehicle "found" and "not found" pages

5. Vehicle "found" page highlights "Taxed" and "MOT" if expired

6. "finish" page after successful vehicle searches

7. Custom 404 page


a) Project was build with activator
b) Needs Java 8 to run
c) ScalaTest was used instead of default specs2
d) Search for "AE64 RAU" and "AE64 OLD" vehicles "MINI"
e) Looks best in Firefox or Chrome

requires: activator-launch-1.3.7.jar

And... I own the "AE64 RAU" MINI hardcoded into this application!
